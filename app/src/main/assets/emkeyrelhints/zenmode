   Dearest Customer,
   You've activated the battery-saving zen mode.
   This mode will disable animations.
   However, battery will be saved by huge amounts.
   Some beta testers reported 75% decrease in battery usage.
   If all you care about is showing off the animations though.
   Then maybe this is not for you.
