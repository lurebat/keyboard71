   Dear Customer, how are you doing today?
   The 123 button at the bottom-left have been replaced.
   You can disable this at the hex shortcuts options.
   You can now hold the 123 button with your left finger to activate the hex shortcuts.
   Makes it easier, doesn't it?
   But now you can't slide from 123 to the symbols, like in the stock keyboard.
   You can still flick right at it to activate the number pad though.
   May be an inconvenience for some, but who knows?
   Use at your discretion.
