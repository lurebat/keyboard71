   Dearest Customer,
   I saw you typing rather aggressively with only a single swipe for the whole word.
   It's better to construct words with multiple swipes
   For example, with the word "CAPITAL"
   Try slide "CA", with your left thumb.
   Then slide "PI" with your right thumb
   Then slide "TA" with your left thumb
   Then finally tap "L" with your right thumb.
   You don't have to do mental acrobatics to get the whole word in one finger movement.
   Maybe once you're an expert, you can.
   But maybe you're just starting.
   One step at a time.
   Say one thing about Nintype, say it's forgiving.
