   Dearest Customer,
   You may be reading this message with low resolution.
   That's maybe because safe mode is enabled.
   Retina resolution is disabled, but graphics memory is 4x less.
   You see, as of recent iOS versions, Apple restricts memory,
   like my parents used to restrict my allowances.
   Which is to say, pretty restrictive.
   But you don't care about looks as much as functionality right?
   Remember, form follows function.
   Beauty is on the inside.
