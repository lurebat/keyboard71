>>The Topbar!

You'll love the topbar. You can use it to correct previous words.

Why is it so good though? You'll notice that sometimes when you type, your eyes look at the keyboard, and sometimes it looks at the text being typed.

But a lot of the time, those two places are far apart. One is at the bottom of the screen, the other often at the top!

When writing long texts, this becomes totally unusable!

And this is where the topbar comes in. You don't have to strain your eyes looking up and down. The topbar will allow you to know what you typed without having to look too far up from the keyboard, meaning you can type faster! It's also a lot more comfortable this way, because your peripheral vision will be able to guide your finger slides better, since you won't have to blind-type (or touch-type rather).

Even better, you can easily correct things from the topbar. Just tap a word, and you'll see it pop up with word alternatives so you can quickly get the word you wanted.

If the word you wanted is not there though? Tap the pen icon and you'll be able to retype exactly on that spot.

You can also quickly switch capitalization of the word from there.

It's really great. You can hide the topbar but I don't recommend it. You can also have a thinner topbar, but why would you? It's better to have a thicker topbar so it's easier to touch!

In short, this topbar is better than other keyboard's topbar.

You say you want next word choices? Forget next word choices, with this keyboard you'll be able to type faster by not having to pause, look at three possible words which could appear at different positions, and tapping those.

Seriously, forget next word prediction. You can type faster and more comfortably without next word prediction.
