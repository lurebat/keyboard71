>>Found a bug!

Well, mail yose@jormy.com if it's a bug that's specific to nintype.

If somehow an app freezes or crashes while using nintype (and nintype keeps working), that's the app's fault. Feel free to nag me about it, but I doubt I'll be able to do anything about it.

If nintype fails to pop up.. that's an iOS issue. Would you mind filing a radar report? It seems like it's the only way to get Apple's attention on that issue.

That would also do me a lot of solids.

Otherwise, go to reddit.com/r/nintype and ask around and see what others think!

You can also tweet @jormy about it.
