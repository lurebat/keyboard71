>> Themes!

There's a bunch of themes available for nintype. You can also edit your own, but right now it's a little hard to use.

>> Light vs Dark

iOS has two different keyboard 'styles' : dark and light.

e.g Spotlight search uses dark, and messages uses light.

Nintype can have separate themes for each of these two 'styles', and when you select the theme to use - it says up the top which you're actually setting the theme for (light keyboard or dark keyboard)

>> The Future

I'll make it better soon, and improve the theme engine, but I'm le tired (Dec, 2015).
