>> Backspace Deletes Whole Words?

By default a backspace tap will delete a whole word.

But what if you want to delete just a single letter? Or two letters?

Try slide left from the backspace key. You can delete letter by letter!

But wait, you can slide back right after sliding left, and it'll restore the deleted words.

Magic!

By the way, you can change the behavior of the backspace tap from the options menu. Just search for "backspace" from the option search, and it's one of the items. Should be pretty self explanatory.
