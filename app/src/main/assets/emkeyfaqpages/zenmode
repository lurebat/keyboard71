>> Zen Mode!

What's the whole point of zen mode?

It disables most of the animations. It also saves a lot of battery usage, because rendering animations and the like uses quite a bit more battery than when there's no animation.

Having said that, it seems to matter not much at all on the latest phones, because they're much more powerful and efficient at graphics animation.

Still, it might matter a little bit, if you're stranded on the desert and need to conserve battery.
