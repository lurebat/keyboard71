>> Stockmode!

You paid money for this keyboard (or maybe you didn't), but you don't feel like trying the slide input?

Never fear, because now nintype has "Stockmode", which attempts to replicate the behavior of normal keyboards. You know, autocorrect while typing normally etc. Slides are disabled.

With the added advantage of the topbar and all the other features nintype comes with, that doesn't have anything to do with slide inputs.

You can still use shortcuts, perform edge slides and the like.

Just go to options -> more and enable Stockmode. You can also then disable slidemode.

If you just want a keyboard without autocorrect at all, just use peckmode then.

Peckmode has been improved in terms of usability, so you might really like it.
