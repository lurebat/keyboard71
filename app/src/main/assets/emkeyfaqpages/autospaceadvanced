Have you seen the autospace tutorial?

Seriously, try it, and you'll find that it's great.

But if I were to give you a tip on how to use autospace, it' just to pretend that your eye is psychically tapping spacebar, instead of your finger.

You have to get comfortable with normal nintype typing without autospace first though.
