>> Weird Capitalization

What's wrong with the word's capitalization?

You can fix it by peck-typing the word (not on peckmode, by the way) with the capitalization that you want.

Alternatively, type the word again, and force-press the caps key.

Or you can tap the word on the topbar, slide left, and tap the word that you want to edit the capitalization of. You can then edit the default capitalization state of that word.
