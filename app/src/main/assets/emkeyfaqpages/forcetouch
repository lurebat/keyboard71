>> 3D Touch!

If your phone allows it, you can use 3D touch on nintype. Make sure 3D touch is enabled from your iOS settings first (it's usually on by default).

Force-pushing spacebar will enable an alternative set of keys, mostly symbols and numbers. Force push even harder and you'll see another set of keys. You'll have to use two fingers for this functionality though.

Remember, you can edit those items by press-holding them.

Force push on the alphabet keys can have three different behavior.

>> Force Key

In this mode, force pushing on an alphabet key will allow you to access the alternative keys for that letter.

>> Force Peck

Force pressing a letter will disable autocorrect, temporarily.

>> Force Autocomplete

In this mode, you can use autocomplete by strong-sliding the first section of the word, and finish by lightly tapping the ender of the word, or by tapping spacebar.

For example, Force+SE  + light-tap-y = SEriousl(y)

You'll have to have typed the word previously for this to work.

This one is a little hard to get used to, actually.
