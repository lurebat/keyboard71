>>Super Quick Typing

In a nutshell, use two fingers to type, use autospace, and just gain experience with nintype.

It goes without saying that you have to know your way around the QWERTY keyboard or whatever layout you're using to begin with.

But it's pretty doable. It's like learning how to ride a bicycle, as it's something a little different than typing on standard tap keyboards, but it'll eventually become second nature and you'll be able to do it easily.

Just like walking
