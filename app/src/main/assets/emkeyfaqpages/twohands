>>Two Hand Typing

Heyo there, Akimbo Cowboy. Or are you?

If you want to use the most out of nintype, you probably want to use two hands. You can still use one hands though, in fact the author (yours truly) sometimes have to do it out of necessity.

Using iPad pro's pencil also means only using one hand. It's doable.

But to get the most out of it, you should try two hands. It makes typing some words WAY faster, words like "amazing", "analysis", "Pamela". 

Why? because your finger don't have to travel from left to right to left to right all the time, since your left finger can cover the left side, and your right finger can cover the right side.

It will take some time to get used to if you're not used to typing with two fingers with (even with stock keyboards), but it's definitely worth it.

With autospace, the developer (yours truly) can get up to 150 words per minute at times. Quite effortlessly too, because you just have to slide as opposed to having to actually press physical buttons.

So yeah, try use two hands.
