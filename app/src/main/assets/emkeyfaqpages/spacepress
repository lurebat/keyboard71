>>Why do I have to press space after every word?

That's because by default, autospace is off.

You can turn it on, but wait!

Since you're probably new to the keyboard, try use the keyboard without autospace first!

Without autospace, you can combine taps and slides as you see fit. This is good if you're used to tapping every letter, like in your garden type variety keyboards.

Unlike other keyboards which allow sliding touch input, nintype allows you to build multiple slides to form a word. You can combine taps and slides to form the word "awesome", for example

A-W-E-S with your left finger,

O-M with your right finger,

and tap an E on the left.

That's why you have to press space. Otherwise nintype wouldn't know when you finished the word. In other keyboards that action will create three separate words.

But wait, autospace still exists! The trick to nintype's autospace is that it uses timing. So you basically have to be comfortable enough with nintype first before attempting autospace.
