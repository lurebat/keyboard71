>>Adding Punctuations

So usually you have to go through two taps to add punctuations (periods, commas, question marks), but that's not the case with nintype.

I mean you can do it the old way by tapping the 123 button, and then tapping the . , and ? buttons.

But you can do it even faster. Just slide down the bottom!

You can slide from the V key to the spacebar, and you can add a comma.

You can slide down from the M key, to the spacebar, to add a period key.

You can also slide down from the backspace key, to add an exclamation mark.

And finally, you can slide up from the return key to add a question mark.

There's more, and you can find them out pretty easily.
