:can't type some words!

Yes you can, just do it! Properly, that is.

But if you can't slide a word, maybe that word isn't in the dictionary?

In which case, peck-type it and you'll get it.

Otherwise it might be your technique that's bad?

Hard to say, but you should go through the interactive tutorials to see how to get it done properly!
