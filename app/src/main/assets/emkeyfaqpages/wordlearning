:Word Learning

How does nintype learn new words?

If a word isn't in the dictionary, peck-type them first (on slidemode, not peckmode though) and after that you'll be able to use it by sliding.

The new word will be then given a 'pending' status.

After you use the word for a bit, it'll be 'induced' into the main dictionary. 

If you backspace on the word, however, it'll reduce the pending score by one, and after you keep on backspacing on the word, eventually it'll be rid of.

If you don't use the word after a few months, it'll be forgotten, unless it got induced to the main dictionary.

The developer (yours truly) thinks this works quite well, after using the keyboard for a while himself.

The starting dictionary is less than perfect but you can get rapidly fix it by adding your own words rather easily, so it's not that big of a deal, mostly.

(I will get to that dictionary quality improvements soon though, but time is short)
