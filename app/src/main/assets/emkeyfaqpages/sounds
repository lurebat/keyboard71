>> Sounds!

You can have sounds that work smoothly on nintype now!

But it requires open access, for what's possibly a combination of 'Policy' and 'Kernel Limitations' issues.

Anyway, you need to enable open access for nintype, which means you'll be greeted with some scary prompts.

I'll make nintype custom sounds later, but right now I'm feeling rather tired.
