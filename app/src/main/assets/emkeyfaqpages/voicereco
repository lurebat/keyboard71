>> Dictation?

Nope, unfortunately not possible right now.

If Apple allows access to siri, I'd implement it in a heartbeat (that's an exaggeration)

But that's not the case.

If Apple allows access to the microphone, that'll require me to implement some kind of voice recognition system, which ain't simple.

So yeah, no hope for dictation, for now. Sorry!
