>> What is Peckmode?

On the right part of the topbar,. you'll see an icon. Tap it once, and you'll be on peckmode. Tap it again and you'll be back on Slidemode.

Peckmode is for when you want to type URLs and things like that. It behaves just like a standard keyboard with no autocorrect. Letters get typed as it appears. You'll see outlines around the keys when you activate peckmode.

When you type in peckmode, words won't be automatically learned, which may be a good thing depending on your situation.

You can still tap-type on slidemode, but when you do so, nintype will think you're learning a new word. Just so you know.

Slidemode is meant for slide input, whereas Peckmode is meant for peck-typing (perhaps if you have to type in some non-english language quickly?).
