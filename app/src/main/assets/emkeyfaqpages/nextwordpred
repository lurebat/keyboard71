>>Next Word Prediction

You won't need it if you can type fast enough. Seriously, rather than having to move your eye focus to the keyboard, then think which 3 of the choices are the one you want, you can just type fast enough so that those choices become irrelevant.

Besides, having the topbar show historical word choices is much more useful.

I actually did implement next word prediction, but in hindisght, it was a waste of time.
