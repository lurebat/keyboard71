>> Shortcuts!

You can assign texts into shortcuts. You can assign actions into shortcuts. But how?

To start with, you can have shortcuts in the topbar. You'll have to enable topbar pin shortcuts from options search first though.

Force key actions are almost always editable into shortcuts.

Key popups (that appear when you press-hold a letter key) can be edited into shortcuts.

In general, you can assign shortcuts by holding your finger still while on an action. It will bring up a shortcut editing prompt.

From that shortcut editing prompt, you can save the current line into the shortcut, browse from recently recorded clipboard texts, or select from a bunch of actions.

It can be convenient for saving email addresses, home addresses and really common things like common signatures and common texts.
