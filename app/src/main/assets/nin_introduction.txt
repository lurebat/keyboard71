Hello!

You probably care more about the custom keyboard than this app itself.

Press Home Button, Go to iOS Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Add New Keyboard.
Add Nintype.
You can then switch to nintype using the globe button at the bottom left of the keyboards.

Try it out on the iOS notes app, for your best learning experience!

Follow @jormy at twitter for updates and the like.

You can get really quick support at reddit.com/r/nintype. Easy to register, don't even need your email!

Keyboard options is at the keyboard. Press and hold spacebar to open the options.

Feel free to mail yose@jormy.com for comments, etc. I get a lot of emails but I will try to answer questions whenever possible.

This app cannot access the keyboard options because of open access restrictions.

This keyboard will be continually updated for a long while until it's super stable.

---------------------------

Now, as for the nintype app itself

Slide left and right to navigate.

Most menus are operated through sliding.

The keyboard is special, instead of tapping the letters, you can slide between them instead. And you can use both hands while doing that!

There's more tutorials on other files. Find them!

Thanks, and enjoy!
