For Shovelry!
Choose the Kestrel!
Ain't nobody got -- time for that!
What is a man?
S-s-senpai!
You Need -- Vitamin C++!
Gimme a big hug!
WINTER IS COMING
Life is short, bury!
You spoony bard!
Are you trained -- in gorilla warfare?
In this moment -- I am euphoric
Are you stoic? -- Got aesthetics?
she thinks -- my tractor's sexy
He was a punk -- She did ballet
walking fast, faces passed -- and I'm homebound
Only you can -- prevent forest fires!
Smang It -- Smash It Bang It
What is love? -- Baby don't hurt me
I said hey! -- What's going on?
Seafoam Green -- Is in fashion!
This boy is fueled -- like fire!
I NEED SCISSORS -- SIXTY ONE!
Do a raw blink -- on hara-kiri rock!
I don't know -- where my soul is
I thought my -- love is rare
Don't kill -- the prosterino!
And I feel -- Like I just got home!
Do you believe -- In life after love?
I'll be coming -- for you anyway
I get up -- And nothing gets me down!
C++ > Java -- Sorry folks, strewth!
C++ > C# -- Sorry folks, strewth!
Shout, shout -- let it all out
smooth digestion -- is key to happiness
