task:
   Now let's try more!
   join multiple slides into a single word!
   target: nicely
   script: 2n-i! 2c-e! 2l-y!


task:
   let's start simple
   make sure you give it time
   autophrase: poo poo moo

task:
   let's start simple
   make sure you give it time
   autophrase: in my car


task:
   try this one
   it's not that hard
   autophrase: how are you

task:
   try this one
   it's not that hard
   autophrase: too soon mate

task:
   Brake at the "R" key to hint
   Hint the word so you won't have to choose 'em
   target: art
   script: 1a-r-t!
   
task:
   This one is commonly used
   target: i'll
   script: 2i-'-l! 2l!
   The apostrophe hints the system!
task:
   let's try another one!
   Like 'thing' for example
   target: thing
   script: 2t-h-i-n-g!

task:
   peck the 'k' in between the left finger slide!
   timing is kinda important here!
   target: fake
   script: 1f-a 2k! 1e!

task:
   this one is a simple word
   target: too
   script: 2t-o! 2o!
   tap 'o' at the end to tell nintype of it!
   
task:
   or simply just peck the letters
   like with this one!
   target: is
   script: 2i! 1s!

:flashwords on

text: 30 seconds tutorial begins now.   Are  you  ready?

text: slide your finger.   follow the paths   [autoend]

task:
   Let's try with two fingers!
   Just follow the ghost fingers!
   target: nice
   script: 2n-i! 1c-e!
   
text: Good!  that's the basics.   Now try with two hands.   [autoend] 

task:
   Now let's try more!
   join multiple slides into a single word!
   target: nicely
   script: 2n-i! 2c-e! 2l-y!
   
text: Baby, Baby!  Close your eyes!  [autoend]

task:
   you can combine taps and slides
   make them a single word!
   target: pins
   script: 2p-i-n! 1s!
   
task:
   let's try this one!
   remember, tap the 'p'
   target: zap
   script: 1z-a! 2p!
   
task:
   peck the 'k' in between the left finger slide!
   timing is kinda important here!
   target: fake
   script: 1f-a 2k! 1e!
   
text: So by now the textbox is probably full of text, and you need a quick way to delete the texts.

text: You can do that quickly by sliding LEFT from the spacebar!
   
task:
   Try it!
   target: slide backspace!
   wantedaction: IA_SlideBackspace
   script: notext 2\<-x!
   You can slide back to the right too!
   
text: you can also just tap the letters normally, like the traditional keyboard. It makes sense for some words! Not very many words though.

task:
   or simply just peck the letters
   like with this one!
   target: is
   script: 2i! 1s!
   
text: Now let's combine them all together! slides and pecks together, and you'll see how comfortable it is!

task:
   remember, try use two fingers!
   it'll make your life easier!
   target: polymers
   script: 2p-o-l-y-m! 1e-r-s!
   
task: 
   now let's combine the different ones
   try to follow the finger
   target: amazing
   script: 1a! 2m! 1a-z! 2i-n-g!
   
task:
   Let's try again with another one!
   target: awesome
   script: 1a-w-e-s! 2o-m! 1e!
   Remember, build up the word!
   
text: when you build words with clusters of letter slides and individual letter taps, you can type faster than ever. It also lets nintype guess your word better, than if you slide the whole thing through!

task:
   Let's try a harder word now
   just watch the ghost fingers
   target: seriously
   script: 1s-e-r! 2i-o-u 1s! 2l-y!
   
task:
   How about this one?
   target: magical
   script: 2m! 1a! 2g-i 1c-a! 2l!
   
task:
   Can you do this one?
   target: changes
   script: 1c! 2h! 1a! 2n-g! 1e-s!
task:
   Keep it up!
   target: everything
   script: 1e! 2v! 1e-r! 2y-t-h-i-n-g!

text: Remember. this is Nintype. Timing is important, so tap the letters roughly in the order they appear in the word.
   
task:
   now try this one
   don't forget the 'e' tap in the end
   target: people
   script: 2p 1e! 2o-p-l! 1e!
   
text: but what do you do with words with double letters? For example, the words "son" vs "soon", "to" vs "too"?

text: You just tap the letter again, or include the letter in more than one slide!
   
task:
   this one is a simple word
   target: too
   script: 2t-o! 2o!
   tap 'o' at the end to tell nintype of it!
   
task:
   Now try this simple word!
   target: son
   script: 1s! 2o-n!
   Easy isn't it?
   
task:
   Pay attention to the tap at 'o'!
   target: soon
   script: 1s! 2o! 2o-n!
   You just need to 'o' again
   
task:
   Alternatively, for double letters,
   target: pool
   script: 2p-o! 2o-l!
   Just release and re-tap at that letter!
   
text: remember, releasing and re-tapping on double letters in words helps nintype know which word you mean (for example, "soon" instead of "son")

text: however, sometimes this double letter thing is optional, only necessary so nintype doesn't confuse it between similar words. Some words are obvious enough, you can skip the double letter hinting completely.

task:
   This word has many double letters
   target: assassin
   script: 1a-S-a-S! 2i-n!
   But it's obvious, no need to hint
   
task:
   many words with double letters
   target: jimmy
   script: 2j-i-m-y!
   don't need hints either

text: However, for words that ends in double letters, tapping the extra letter will really help nintype with the prediction!
   
task:
   For example, this word
   target: guess
   script: 2g-u! 1e-s! 1s!
   Just do us a solid, and tap the ending 's'
   
task:
   This one too
   target: fill
   script: 1f! 2i-l! 2l!
   Less ambiguity, better typing experience!
   
task:
   Now try this one out
   target: impressed
   script: 2i-m-p! 1r-e-S-e-d!
   An advanced word, indeed.
   
text: You'll get a feel on which words you need to double-tap on as you type more with nintype. It'll just come to you naturally as you use nintype more and more.

text: one last thing! what about words with apostrophes in them?

text: You just need to slide through the apostrophe key, on the right side of the L key!
  
task:
   Hint apostrophe by going through here!
   target: i'm
   script: 2i-'-m!
   Just slide through that key!
task:
   And yet another example!
   target: it's
   script: 2i 1t 2'! 1s!
   The apostrophe hints the system!
task:
   This one is commonly used
   target: i'll
   script: 2i-'-l! 2l!
   The apostrophe hints the system!
   
task:
   And then try this one toO!
   target: you'll
   script: 2y-o-u-'-L!
   See how easy it is?
   
text: Just one more thing..
   
text: nintype depends on the dictionary, if a word isn't in it you have to peck-type it first

task:
   if a word isn't in the dictionary
   peck-type them first!
