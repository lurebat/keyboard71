The word 'go' doesn't rhyme with 'do' but rhymes with 'slow'. 'Cow' doesn't rhyme with 'slow' but rhymes with 'plough'. 'Through' and 'dough' rhyme with neither each other nor 'plough', but rhyme with 'clue and 'foe' respectively. Learning English pronounciation must be a nightmare. (self.Showerthoughts)
